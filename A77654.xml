         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>OH Sir, I am glad to ſee you: what <hi>Anno aetatis ſuae</hi> 72. and yet ſo brave and luſty? having not of late ſeen any thing from you, It was afraid that the difficulty of finding out <hi>Self-murderer,</hi> had tempted you to make upon your ſelf ſome fatal experiment; like the <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> when he could not ſolve the motion of the <hi>Sea,</hi> threw himſelf into it.</p>

               <p>I muſt confeſs, <hi>Harry,</hi> I have been of late (but much againſt my inclinations) very uſeleſs; my tallent and the preſent current of Affairs are diametrically oppoſite: had the Church of <hi>England men</hi> been our own, I could have run diviſions upon the Diſſenters <hi>ad infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum;</hi> I would have proved them a pack of Rebels for a whole Century; I would have made the laſt 88 to be of a piece with this; and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Armada ſhould have been believed to be no more than a Phanatick Conſpiracy.</p>

               <p>Has not Sir <hi>Roger</hi> cleared that difficulty ſufficiently? when he told you, <hi>that when they are rightly diſtinguiſhed, they may very well ſtand together; for the degrees of the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>are Religious, this Liberty you are offered is a civil point.</hi> [Anſwer to the Letter to Diſſenters. p. 7.]</p>

               <p>Well now I find true, what I always ſuſpected; that this <hi>Liberty</hi> was grounded upon a trick of <hi>ſtate;</hi> and not upon a <hi>Religious</hi> convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of judgment. So that when the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall not ſtand in need of ſuch Arts; that is, when Popery is too powerful to ſubmit to ſuch condeſcenſions; we muſt expect to be thrown off, and ſink again into the ſtate of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering.</p>

               <p>I do aſſure you, it has been the <hi>conſtant</hi> judgment of Papiſts, that men all ought to have <hi>Liberty of Conſcience:</hi> and they are very ill men, and you ought not to joyn with them who wou'd perſwade you to the contrary.</p>

               <p>I find you ſtill continue in your ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſuſpicion of the Papiſts: methinks they are the moſt reaſonable men alive; for if they do repeal your Laws, they promiſe you <hi>Equipollent ſecurities.</hi>

               <p>I muſt tell you <hi>Harry,</hi> the <hi>Papiſts</hi> are the worſt men in the world to pretend to <hi>enſure</hi> the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion from Fire and Fagot. their love to Hereticks we know, is generally <hi>hot</hi> and <hi>flameing</hi> and 'tis rarely that any of them vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to <hi>kiſs,</hi> but when 'tis to bring in others that come with <hi>Swords</hi> and <hi>Staves.</hi> And what is this <hi>Equipollent</hi> ſecurity to be? an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament.</hi>

               <p>Yes, but ſuch an Act that ſhall be unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable, and not in the power of future Ages to revoke.</p>

               <p>Hold, not too faſt there, you will ruin the <hi>Diſpencing Power</hi> elſe; for if the King may not <hi>ſuſpend that Act too</hi> at pleaſure, what will become of thoſe Officers, who have made ſo bold with the Laws in being? for the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence muſt reach all Acts alike.</p>

               <p>And will not <hi>that Law,</hi> think you, be <hi>unjuſt,</hi> which cramps the Kings <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi> right of <hi>ſuſpending</hi> Acts or Parliament? ſo that <hi>this Law</hi> or the mighty Prerogative of <hi>ſuſpending</hi> immediately falls to the ground: and which do you think will moſt likely get the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on't? Beſides that Law, if it be <hi>equipolent</hi> muſt exclude all <hi>Romiſh Prieſts</hi> from Officiating in any publick Church or Chappel within the Kingdom.
